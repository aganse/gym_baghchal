Tentative list of bugs to fix...

1. when a tiger has no move, is it doing wrong thing and moving anyway?

2. goats need to know they've won - game needs to know that tigers cannot move,
whether human or computer is playing tiger

3. if hplayer is goat, you can enter "d3,c2" without a complaint -
it will only use the d3 part, but it should probably give an error...

4. for checking for win - maybe change check_for_win() into
check_for_goats_all_taken() (or probably just replace with its "if" statemnt)
and have determine...() return a state for NO_FURTHER_TIGER_MOVES.  
but needs to be a way that that's also checked after the computer's move
is done... maybe keeping all the checks within check_for_win() is still
a good idea after all.  Anyway, so there's the issue.

5. concerns that it's mostly Nepali folks who've been playing with this
thing online, but online access is so expensive over there that I should
give up this CGI approach and do a standalone program.

6. 20th goat can't be played?  Can't make goat moves after 21st round?

7. tiger moving into goat-occupied position after following moves?
e3,e2,d1,c1,a3,a4,d5,e5,e1,d2,c2,d3,b5
